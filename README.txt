This is my first Python project!
I decided to make my own case opening simulator for CS:GO, because even though I don't play this game much anymore I do like the case opening aspect of it, so to sway myself away from making... less than advisable financial decisions I made this 
simulator to get the idea of how much a case is worth buying. It's meant to show how much you gained from opening said case by scraping values of the skins on Steam marketplace using BS4. Values on which this program rolls skins are taken from 
what internet told me and I think they are fairly accurate.

Keep in mind:
Because this program has to scrape the marketplace a lot of times, it eventually gets blocked for some time and that makes it stop working so its advisable to not roll more than 50 skins (max I did was 65)
