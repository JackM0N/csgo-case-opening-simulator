This is my first Python project!
I decided to make my own case opening simulator for CS:GO, because even though I don't play this game much anymore I do like the case opening aspect of it, so to sway myself away from making... less than advisable financial decisions I made this 
simulator to get the idea of how much a case is worth buying. It's meant to show how much you gained from opening said case by scraping values of the skins on Steam marketplace using BS4

Current issues:
- its fairly slow (can take a couple of minutes)
- because this program has to scrape the marketplace a lot of times, it eventually gets blocked for some time and that makes it stop working so its advisable to not roll more than 50 skins (max I did was 65)
